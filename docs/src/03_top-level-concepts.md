- **Groups:** Collections of users that share common access permissions. Groups simplify permission management by allowing administrators to assign roles and access levels to multiple users simultaneously.

**Best Practices:**

- **Role Assignment:** Assign users to groups based on their roles (e.g., data scientists, data engineers, analysts) to streamline access management.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant users the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious data exposure.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

**Access Control Lists (ACLs)** provide granular control over permissions for various workspace objects, including notebooks, clusters, jobs, tables, and MLflow runs.

**Components of ACLs:**

1. **User-Level Permissions:**
   - **Read:** Allows viewing of the object.
   - **Write:** Permits modifications to the object.
   - **Manage:** Grants full control, including the ability to alter permissions.

2. **Group-Level Permissions:**
   - Apply the same set of permissions to all users within the group, simplifying management for teams.

3. **Object-Level Permissions:**
   - **Workspace Level:** Controls access to the entire workspace.
   - **Cluster Level:** Manages permissions related to cluster creation, management, and usage.
   - **Job Level:** Governs access to job creation, modification, and execution.
   - **Table Level:** Regulates read and write access to specific tables within databases.
   - **MLflow Level:** Controls access to experiment tracking and model management functionalities.

**Usage Example: Setting ACLs for a Notebook**

1. Navigate to the desired notebook within the workspace.
2. Click on the **"Permissions"** option.
3. Add users or groups and assign the appropriate permission level (Read, Write, Manage).
4. Save the changes to enforce the new access controls.

**Example Scenario: Restricting Deletion Permissions**

Suppose an organization wants to allow users to create and modify notebooks but prevent them from deleting critical notebooks. This can be achieved by assigning **Read** and **Write** permissions while excluding **Manage** permissions.

```plaintext
User: johndoe@example.com
Permissions: Read, Write
```

**Impact:**

- **Read:** `johndoe` can view the notebook content.
- **Write:** `johndoe` can modify and execute the notebook.
- **Manage:** `johndoe` cannot delete or alter permissions for the notebook.
